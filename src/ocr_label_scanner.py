"""OCR Label Scanner — Proof of Concept (Task 6).

Takes a photo of a packaged-food label and extracts the printed text using
Tesseract OCR (via ``pytesseract`` + ``Pillow``), then parses out:

  * the **ingredient list** (everything after the "Ingredients:" heading), and
  * any **nutrition facts** it can find (sugar, sodium/salt, saturated fat,
    protein, fiber, energy) as per-serving numbers,

so the result can be fed straight into Swapify's existing scoring engine
(``calculate_health_score_v2`` in app.py) — no separate scoring logic lives here.

Design notes
------------
* **Optional dependency.** Tesseract is not always installed (it's a native
  binary plus two Python packages). This module never imports them at module
  load; ``ocr_available()`` reports whether OCR can run and, if not, why. The
  FastAPI app imports this module unconditionally and simply returns a helpful
  503 when OCR isn't installed, so the rest of the backend keeps working.
* **Proof of concept.** Real-world label OCR needs image preprocessing
  (deskew, threshold, denoise) and a trained ingredient parser. This POC does a
  light grayscale + autocontrast pass and heuristic parsing — enough to
  demonstrate the end-to-end flow: image → text → ingredients → score.

Install (to actually run OCR):
    pip install pytesseract Pillow
    # plus the Tesseract engine itself:
    #   Windows : https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki  (then add to PATH
    #             or set TESSERACT_CMD to the tesseract.exe path)
    #   macOS   : brew install tesseract
    #   Linux   : sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
